# Dmytro's project

#### for C.T.Co

### Tools that was used :

- Selenide;
- Cucumber;
- jUnit5;
- AssertJ;

### For automation task I've chosen selenide instead of selenium because it's easier

to implement:

- Webriver configuration not needed
- Easy to pick browser (Chrome,Firefox,Opera)
- You can work with elements directly including condition
- No need to create Actions\WebDriwerWait
- No need to initialize elements
- No need to pass driver

#### To Run test - use 'mvn clean test'

### For task with 'DatePicker'
